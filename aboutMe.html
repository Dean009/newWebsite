				Iâ€™m a current student with The Open University, studying BSc (Honours) Computing and IT in my last year of study looking to move into a position that 
				utilises the skills I have developed in the first two years of study combined with previous work experience, to progress towards my goal of being a software 
				developer in a fast-paced and challenging environment where I am always learning with room for growth. I am a very self-motivated person, able 
				to work independently and self-learn or within a team to complete assignments. 
				I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Python and primarily Java; I am always looking to further my understanding of these languages and explore others. As a keen reader (I read 100+ books a year) 
				I am always looking to improve myself and learn topics that I am unfamiliar with.  
				My eventual career goal is to become a website/software developer fluent in several languages and to have self-published several apps. <br/>

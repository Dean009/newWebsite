        		<h1>Up Until Now...</h1>
				<p>I always say that I have two main interests that define who I am as a person, being able to combine them would be ideal. Firstly, I have since around the age of about 
				7 been into technology. I used to get technology magazines growing up with whatever pocket money I had. I remember fondly getting a family PC around this time and was 
				addicted to it. I later got one for myself at around 11, and like most kids got into games; strategy games being a favourite. I grew up with an appreciation for technology, always
				trying to learn as much as I could from the guidance I got. I would later go on to build and repair PC's, however, I found myself getting bored fairly quickly. This carried on
				until I was introduces to my first programming language (HTML) at school at around 14. </br> </br>Around the age of 17 I began taking an interest in Science, particularly Physics
				which confused matters. I was always the IT kid growing up but now found myself gravitating towards Physics more and more and stopped learning programming languages and started reading
				religiously about space and how it works. It wasn't until age 22 until I started picking up programming again (with Java), realising that I can have an interest in more than one thing at a time and after delaying University
				until I figured out which way I wanted my life to go I enrolled at The Open University, choosing the on-line University over a traditional campus University due to wanting to work through my studies. </p>

				<h2>Looking Ahead...</h2>
				<p>
				On the hobby side of things, I love Music. I listen to music around 5-6 hours a day and love all genres, I like driving to Rap/Rock and listen to more classical/soundtracks when studying. I have been learning 
				how to play electric guitar for around 5 months. I try to watch as many TV shows as possible, however with a heavy study/work schedule it becomes difficult to find the time. I like traveling around picturesque
				areas snapping photos, and have a long term goal of living outside the UK. Living in northern Norway would be the dream and I have plans to climb Kilimanjaro before I'm 35 and visit an observatory as soon as possible.
				To say I'm a big reader would be an underestimation, I try to read 100 books a year time permitting and love both fiction and non-fiction. A current goal of mine is to publish 5 apps on the Google Play store before I'm 27.

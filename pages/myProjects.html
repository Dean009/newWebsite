		<h4>Flappy bird clone can be found <a href = "https://github.com/Dean009/Flappy-Bird-2">here.</a></h4>
		<p></br>
		I decided that I wanted to create a game, this was around the time when Flappy Bird was making headlines
		and so I thought about trying my hand at making a clone. I did learn a lot in doing so however left the project
		with a couple bugs still in the system.
		</p>
		
		<h4>The note taking application can be found <a href = "https://github.com/Dean009/note_take"> here.</a></h4>
		<p></br>
		I started this application purely as a technical challenge, I did not spend much time on the visual aspect of the 
		app leaving it look like a 90's application. I started working with windows and containers, learning how the 
		hierarchy works within Java. This was my most planned out project, creating paper prototypes and attempting to 
		stick to the plan as much as possible. 
		</p>
		
		<h4>Snake clone can be found <a href = "https://github.com/Dean009/Snake_C-1">here.</a></h4>
		<p></br>
		This was my first development in C#, doing so purely for it's technical aspect. I already had some knowledge of 
		a C based language and so it was not as difficult as my Java project (as that was my first). Again, I did not 
		stay with the project to improve the visuals and instead will focus another project purely on the visual aspect of the 
		language.
